Unlimited Mercenary Clans
=========================

Allow more than 3 minor factions to be hired as mercenary into player kingdom.

#### Compatibility

- e1.4.1

#### Details

The mod uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to patch
*LordConversationsCampaignBehavior* in the Sandbox DLL, removing the limit of
having 3 mercenary clans at max. This has no effect on normally recruited minor
factions through persuasion.


#### Troubleshooting

The mod uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to patch the Sandbox
DLL. If it fails errors would be written into
_error.UnlimitedMercenaryClans.log_ under TEMP folder.
